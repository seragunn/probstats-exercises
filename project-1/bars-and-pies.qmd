# Activity 1

## Dice activity

::: {#exr-dice-activity}
1. Take two dice and roll the pair of them 25 times, **keeping track of the sum of
their values**. Record this and following answers on a blank piece of paper.
Fill those into the `dice_rolls` variable below.

Your numbers should be between 2 and 12.

```{webr}
dice_rolls = c()
sum_count = table(dice_rolls)
sum_count
```

2. From the `sum_count` table, report how many times you rolled a 2, 3, 4, etc.
   After you have done that, change the last line from `sum_count` to
`barplot(sum_count)` and run that to get a barplot.
3. Which sum (or sums) occurred the most number of times?
4. Based on your data, are we more likely to roll a 2 or a 7?
5. The function `mean()` returns the mean of a dataset. Run the next code box
   and report the mean of the data.
:::
::: {.callout-note}
It is likely the case that in 25 rolls there were some totals you never rolled,
if so, report those numbers as 0.
:::

```{webr}
mean(dice_rolls)
```

## Data activity

R, and it's many packages, contain many different datasets for practicing its
features. One of these is the `starwars` dataset.

You can see the [full dataset here](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/blob/main/data-raw/starwars.csv){target="_blank"}.


::: {#exr-starwars-data}
1. What types of variables are included in this dataset? Give an example for
   each type (quantitative discrete, quantitative continuous, qualitative)
2. We can interact with this data set in R as `starwars`. Specifically we can
   use the `$` operator to specify which column we wish to retrieve. Let's use
this now to create a pie chart of character gender in Star Wars. Make a quick
sketch of the resulting chart.

```{webr}
data = starwars$gender
count = table(data)
pie(count)
```

3. Replace the word `gender` in line 1 by different variables.
For which of these is a pie chart a reasonable way to represent the data
and which of these is a pie chart hard to read meaningful information from?
    * gender
    * sex
    * homeworld
    * species

## Syntax and Functions

* `mean(...)` the mean or average of a list of numbers
* `$` takes a specific column from a dataset e.g. `starwars$height`
* `pie(...)` creates a pie chart
