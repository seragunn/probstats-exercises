As per usual, we define our data in a variable and then use that variable in the boxplot function.\nRemember that the lines of the boxplot correspond to the quartiles (minimum, 25% mark, 50% mark, 75% mark, maximum). A related and quite useful function is summary() which will print out all of these values as numbers for us.\nCompare the output of this command to where the lines of boxplot are positioned.\nHistograms are created with the hist() function. For instance\nUnlike boxplots, we usually want to configure our histogram, i.e. set a number of bins and/or declare the beginning and end of each bin.\nWe can do this by adding breaks=... to the end of our histogram function. And the two most common types of breaks are to set a number of bins or to set where the boundaries of those bins are.\nThere is one more option we need to discuss which is the right=FALSE option. By default, bins will include their right endpoint, so a bin that goes from \\(10\\) to \\(20\\) will include every data point equal to \\(20\\). Adding right=FALSE moves all the \\(20\\) data points into the next bin over (bins will include the left point but not the right point). Compare:\nThere are \\(6\\) data points equal to \\(20\\). In the first histogram those \\(6\\) count for the middle bin, in the second histogram the count for the right bin.",

Search engines and Large Language Models are good tools to use for interpreting error messages. Here the issue is that by default, sample assumes we are drawing numbers from a hat without returning our drawn numbers to the hat (so they will never repeat). To change this behavior, we add replace=TRUE to our function as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.3 Run this and write down the output.\n\nIf you remember, in Activity 1 we we generated a barplot by rolling dice ourselves.

    "text": "10.3 Using software (two-sample hypotheses)\nSuppose we have some data about rates of seasonal depression in New York versus in California. Suppose \\(5\\%\\) of people (\\(x = 62, n = 1240\\)) report seasonal depression in New York versus \\(3\\%\\) (\\(x = 33, n = 1100\\)) in California. We wish to test the claim that the more northern state (New York) has a greater incidence of seasonal depression. We do this with the following R function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10.9  \n\nWrite the hypotheses \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) for our claim about \\(p_1\\) and \\(p_2\\).\nFrom the output, what is the p-value for the claim?\nAt the \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\), does the p-value suggest evidence for the claim that New Yorkers experience a greater incidence rate for seasonal depression? I.e. do we reject \\(H_0\\)?\n\n\n\nA study on the heart rate of (cisgender) men and women collects some data on the resting heart rate of each group of people. The statistician overseeing the project runs the following code to test the hypothesis that these two groups have a different resting heart rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 10.10  \n\nWrite the hypotheses \\(H_0\\) and \\(H_1\\) for our claim about \\(\\mu_1\\) and \\(\\mu_2\\).\nWhat is the mean heart rate for the men in the sample? For the women?\nFrom the output, what is the p-value for the claim?\nAt the \\(\\alpha = 0.01\\), does the p-value suggest evidence for the claim that the two groups have a different resting heart rate?",
