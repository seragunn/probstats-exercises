    "text": "1.1 Syntax and Functions\nR is a programming language for statistical computation and data visualization. It is widely used by stacticians, data scientists, and researchers and has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, statistical modeling, and more. R is free to download, use, and modify.\nR can be installed to your computer, but in class we will use R entirely in the browser. No installation necessary!\nLet’s get started by looking at some code. Press the “Run Code” button or click inside the text-editor and press Ctrl or Cmd + Enter to execute the code. It may take a few seconds for your browser to load the R software.\nTo create a bar graph, we can use the barplot() function:\nYou may have noticed some symbols like # or &lt;- or c(...) in the code. These are called syntax and I will summarize new syntax and functions at the end of each section.",
