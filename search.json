You do not need to report the bar graph.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes your bar graph have a similar shape to the graph for two 6 sided dice?\nOne way to smooth out a bar graph is by grouping neighboring values into the same bin (i.e. a histogram). Take your tallies from part (1) and make a table of the number of 1s and 2s, 3s and 4s, 5s and 6s, etc.\nMake a bar plot (histogram) of this combined tally. No need to sketch this but would you describe the shape of this data to be reasonably uniform?

Let’s extract these variables and use a histogram to help us picture the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2  \n\nNotice that the data doesn’t have just one hill but two hills to it.

In order to visualize that question, we’re going to need to plot both variables at the same time. The tool for this is the scatter plot which puts a point at each \\((x, y)\\) coordinate where \\(x\\) is waiting time and \\(y\\) is an eruption time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.3  \n\nPer the scatter plot, are points which have a lower waiting time (further to the left) associated with a higher or lower eruption time (up/down)?\nIf the waiting time to the latest eruption is 80 minutes, about how long does the trend line predict the eruption time will be? (roughly)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWe will discuss scatter plots in more detail later in the course.",
