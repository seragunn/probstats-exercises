It is widely used by stacticians, data scientists, and researchers and has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, statistical modeling, and more. R is free to download, use, and modify.\nR can be installed to your computer, but in class we will use R entirely in the browser. No installation necessary!\nLet’s get started by looking at some code. Press the “Run Code” button or click inside the text-editor and press Ctrl or Cmd + Enter to execute the code. It may take a few seconds for your browser to load the R software.",

    "text": "4.1 Histograms\nTo create a basic box and whisker plot, we use the boxplot() command. As per usual, we define our data in a variable and then use that variable in the boxplot function.\nRemember that the lines of the boxplot correspond to the quartiles (minimum, 25% mark, 50% mark, 75% mark, maximum). A related and quite useful function is summary() which will print out all of these values as numbers for us.\nCompare the output of this command to where the lines of boxplot are positioned.\nHistograms are created with the hist() function. For instance\nUnlike boxplots, we usually want to configure our histogram, i.e. set a number of bins and/or declare the beginning and end of each bin.\nWe can do this by adding breaks=... to the end of our histogram function. And the two most common types of breaks are to set a number of bins or to set where the boundaries of those bins are.\nThere is one more option we need to discuss which is the right=FALSE option. By default, bins will include their right endpoint, so a bin that goes from \\(10\\) to \\(20\\) will include every data point equal to \\(20\\). Adding right=FALSE moves all the \\(20\\) data points into the next bin over (bins will include the left point but not the right point). Compare:\nThere are \\(6\\) data points equal to \\(20\\). In the first histogram those \\(6\\) count for the middle bin, in the second histogram the count for the right bin.",

Let’s extract these variables and use a histogram to help us picture the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5.3  \n\nNotice that the data doesn’t have just one hill but two hills to it.
