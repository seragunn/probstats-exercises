As per usual, we define our data in a variable and then use that variable in the boxplot function.\nRemember that the lines of the boxplot correspond to the quartiles (minimum, 25% mark, 50% mark, 75% mark, maximum). A related and quite useful function is summary() which will print out all of these values as numbers for us.\nCompare the output of this command to where the lines of boxplot are positioned.\nHistograms are created with the hist() function. For instance\nUnlike boxplots, we usually want to configure our histogram, i.e. set a number of bins and/or declare the beginning and end of each bin.\nWe can do this by adding breaks=... to the end of our histogram function. And the two most common types of breaks are to set a number of bins or to set where the boundaries of those bins are.\nThere is one more option we need to discuss which is the right=FALSE option. By default, bins will include their right endpoint, so a bin that goes from \\(10\\) to \\(20\\) will include every data point equal to \\(20\\). Adding right=FALSE moves all the \\(20\\) data points into the next bin over (bins will include the left point but not the right point). Compare:\nThere are \\(6\\) data points equal to \\(20\\). In the first histogram those \\(6\\) count for the middle bin, in the second histogram the count for the right bin.",

Search engines and Large Language Models are good tools to use for interpreting error messages. Here the issue is that by default, sample assumes we are drawing numbers from a hat without returning our drawn numbers to the hat (so they will never repeat). To change this behavior, we add replace=TRUE to our function as follows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 6.3 Run this and write down the output.\n\nIf you remember, in Activity 1 we we generated a barplot by rolling dice ourselves.

For instance, to simulate this experiment of throwing 5 free throws 100 times, we can use the rbinom function. The output is a list of \\(k\\)’s. E.g. if the output starts 5 4 2 1 ... that means the first simulation had 5 successes, the second 4, the third 2, the fourth 1, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7.3  \n\nRun this cell and write down the first 10 numbers.\nIn those first 10 experiments, what percent of the time did you land exactly \\(3\\) free throws? Is this relative frequency greater than or smaller than the probability you calculated in Exercise 7.1 Q2?\nNow change the line to table(rbinom(...)) to make the summary table we looked at in Lab 1. Write down that table.\nHow many times out of 100 was the number of successes \\(0, 1, 2\\) or \\(3\\)? Is this relative frequency bigger or smaller than the true probability you calculated in Exercise 7.2 Q1?",
