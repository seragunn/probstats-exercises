    "text": "1.1 Syntax and Functions\nR is a programming language for statistical computation and data visualization. It is widely used by stacticians, data scientists, and researchers and has a rich ecosystem of packages and libraries to facilitate data manipulation, visualization, statistical modeling, and more. R is free to download, use, and modify.\nR can be installed to your computer, but in class we will use R entirely in the browser. No installation necessary!\nLet’s get started by looking at some code. Press the “Run Code” button or click inside the text-editor and press Ctrl or Cmd + Enter to execute the code. It may take a few seconds for your browser to load the R software.\nTo create a bar graph, we can use the barplot() function:\nYou may have noticed some symbols like # or &lt;- or c(...) in the code. These are called syntax and I will summarize new syntax and functions at the end of each section.",

To access this, we first load the package with library(\"dplyr\") and then we can preview the dataset by simply writing starwars.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhile not strictly, necessary, I added suppressMessages() to hide the messages that often come up when loading a package.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is just a preview of the first 10 rows of data. Some of the columns aren’t displayed either. You can see the full dataset here.\nIf we want information about the starwars dataset (or any R function), we can use the ? operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2.2  \n\nWhat types of variables are included in this dataset? Which variables are quantitative?\nIf we want to talk about a specific column, like gender, we can use the $ operator. Let’s use this now to create a pie chart of character gender in Star Wars. Make a quick sketch of the resulting chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTry replacing gender by a different column like height, sex, or homeworld. For which of these does it make sense to use a pie chart? For which of these does a pie chart make sense but it would be better to group smaller categories into “other”?",
