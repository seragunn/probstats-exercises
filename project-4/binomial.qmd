# Activity 4

The Binomial Distribution is a model of doing something random several times.
For example, rolling multiple dice or flipping multiple coins.

If $X$ represents the number of successes in $n$ random experiments with a
probability of success of $p$ and probability of failure $q = 1 - p$ then
$$
P(X = k) = nCk \cdot p^k q^{n - k}, \quad \text{Where } nCk = \frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}.
$$ {#eq-binom-pmf}

For example, if $X$ is the number of $6$s rolled among $10$ dice then $p =
\frac16$ is the probability of getting a $6$ and $q = 1 - \frac16 = \frac56$
is the probability of not getting a $6$. So
$$
P(X = k) = P(\text{rolling } k \text{ sixes}) = 10Ck \cdot \left( \frac16 \right)^k \left( \frac56 \right)^{n-k}.
$$

In R, we calculate these probabilities with the `dbinom` function. E.g. for $n = 10, p = \frac16, k = 3$:

```{webr}
dbinom(3, size=10, prob=1/6)

# Same as:

choose(10, 3) * (1/6)^3 * (5/6)^7
```

::: {.callout-note}
This can also be written `dbinom(3, 10, 1/6)` without writing `size=` or
`prob=` but I find it helps to write those explicitly to help know which number
is $k, n$ or $p$.

Suppose in basketball, you are able to successfully make a free throw $70\%$ of
the time or $p = 0.7$.

1. What is the probability that you miss: $q = 1 - p$?
2. If you shoot $5$ times, write down the formula (i.e. write @eq-binom-pmf
   with the given $p, q, n, k$) for the probability that you land $3$ out of
$5$ free throws.
3. Using `dbinom(k, size=n, prob=p)` compute this probability (fill in your
   values for $p, n, k$)
:::

```{webr}
dbinom(k, size=n, prob=p)
```

## Cumulative probabilities

If we change `dbinom` to `pbinom`, we get not the probability of $k$ successes
but the probability of $\le k$ successes.

E.g. the probability of rolling $0, 1$ or $2$ ones among $5$ dice rolls is
```{webr}
dbinom(0, size=5, prob=1/6)
+ dbinom(1, size=5, prob=1/6)
+ dbinom(2, size=5, prob=1/6)

# Or more simply

pbinom(2, size=5, prob=1/6)
```

In math notation:
$$
P(X \le 2) = P(X = 0, 1 \text{ or } 2) = P(X = 0) + P(X = 1) + P(X = 2)
$$

::: {#exr-pbinom}
1. Go back to @exr-dbinom and now instead of calculating the probability of
   making exactly $3$ free throws to the probability of making $\le 3$ free
throws (change `dbinom` to `pbinom`).
2. To get the probability of making $\ge k$ free throws rather than $\le k$ we
   can add `lower.tail=FALSE` to the function (lower tail referring to $\le$).
   Compute the probability of making $\ge 4$ free throws this way.
:::

```{webr}
pbinom(k, size=n, prob=p, lower.tail=FALSE)
```

## Random number generation

We've seen how to calculate probabilities. We can also make simulations. For
instance, to simulate this experiment of throwing 5 free throws 100 times, we
can use the `rbinom` function. The output is a list of $k$'s. E.g. if the
output starts `5 4 2 1 ...` that means the first simulation had 5 successes,
the second 4, the third 2, the fourth 1, etc.

```{webr}
rbinom(100, size=5, prob=0.7)
```

::: {#exr-rbinom}
1. Run this cell and write down the first 10 numbers.
2. In those first 10 experiments, what percent of the time did you land exactly
   $3$ free throws? Is this *relative frequency* greater than or smaller than
the probability you calculated in @exr-dbinom Q2?
3. Now change the line to `table(rbinom(...))` to make the summary table we
   looked at in Lab 1. Write down that table.
4. How many times out of 100 was the number of successes $0, 1, 2$ or $3$? Is
   this relative frequency bigger or smaller than the true probability you
calculated in @exr-pbinom Q1?

## Summary

For $X$ representing the number of successes in $n$ experiments with a probability $p$ of success:

1. $P(X = k)$ is `dbinom(k, size=n, prob=p)`
2. $P(X \le k)$ is `pbinom(k, size=n, prob=p)`
3. $P(X \ge k)$ is `pbinom(k, size=n, prob=p, lower.tail=FALSE)`
4. Generating $100$ sample values for $X$ is `rbinom(100, size=n, prob=p)`
