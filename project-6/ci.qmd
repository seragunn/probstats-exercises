```

A bag contains $10$ balls, some black and some white. You experiment to find
the number of black and white balls by sampling from the bag with replacement.
The following function outputs a 0 if the ball was white and 1 if the ball was black.
We do this 10 times.

```{webr}
random_experiment(10)
```

::: {#exr-random-experiment}
1. Let $p = \frac{\# \mathrm{black}}{10}$ be the probability of drawing a black ball.
   Based on the random experiment above, what is the *point estimate* for $p$?
2. Make a rough bar plot where you rank (from 1 to 5) the likelihood of each of $0$ through $10$ as being the true number of black balls in the bag.
:::

## Using the likelihood function to estimate $p$

::: {.callout-note}
A **likelihood function** is just a probability calculation as a function of
some parameter. E.g. the probability of drawing $5$ black balls out of $10$ is
higher (more likely) when $p = 0.5$ than it is when $p = 0.05$.

Open this [Desmos graph](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/xecihuqobx) in a new tab (right-click â†’ open in new tab).

::: {#exr-desmos}
Complete the following steps than write down your numbers for $u$ and $v$:

1. At the top, let $b =$ the number of 1s you observed in the previous experiment.
2. Starting with $u = 0$ and $v = 1$, slowly drag $u$ to the right until $A$, which represents the area under the curve, is as close to 0.975 (97.5%) as you can make it.
![Moving u to the right until A is approximately 0.975](desmos-left.png)
3. Now move $v$ to the left until $A$ is as close to 0.95 (95%) as you can make it.
![Moving v to the left until A is approximately 0.95](desmos-right.png)
4. Report $u$ and $v$.
:::

::: {.callout-note}
Context: moving $u$ until $A$ was $\approx 97.5\%$ means there was a $2.5\%$
chance of being less than $u$ and likewise a $2.5\%$ change of being bigger
than $v$.
So overall there is a $5\%$ chance of not being between $u$ and $v$ and a
$95\%$ chance of being between $u$ and $v$.
:::

::: {#exr-binom-exact}
The `qbeta` function performs what we just did in Desmos. Specifically, we run
```{webr}
successes <- 8
failures <- 2
qbeta(0.025, successes + 1, failures + 1)
qbeta(0.975, successes + 1, failures + 1)
```
to find $u$ and $v$ respectively. (The $+1$ is due to some $-1$s that appear in the beta distribution behind the scenes.)

1. Change the $8$ and $2$ to your number of 1s (black balls) and 0s (white balls) respectively. Then report the exact values of $u$ and $v$.
2. Rewrite this with your values of $u$ and $v$: "a 95\% CI for p is $(u, v)$."
3. You will notice that this confidence interval is quite wide because with
   only $10$ samples it's hard to pinpoint the true proportion of black balls. Let's change $n$ to $1000$ and try again:
```{webr}
n <- 1000
black <- sum(random_experiment(n))
white <- n - black
c(black, white)
```
Take these numbers back to the `qbeta` box to compute a new $u$ and $v$ and report a new confidence interval (as in 2.).
:::

::: {.callout-note}
*Technically* these `qbeta`-intervals are "credible intervals" not "confidence intervals" but they function the same.
:::

## Using the Normal approximation

Recall our formula for the normal approximation confidence interval is
$$
\hat p \pm 1.96 \sqrt{\frac{\hat p \hat q}{n}}
$$
or more generally, use `qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)` instead of `1.96`.

::: {#exr-binom-approx}
1. With the numbers for $n = 1000$ what are $\hat p$ and $\hat q$? Hint: if we
   saw $413$ black balls, then $\hat p = 413/1000 = 0.413$ (move the decimal
place over). $\hat q$ is the same but for the white balls.
2. Compute $E = 1.96 \sqrt{\hat p \hat q / n}$:
```{webr}
E <- 1.96 * sqrt(0.413 * 0.587 / 1000)
E
```
(modify the $.413$ and $.587$ as necessary).
3. Compute $\hat p - E$ and $\hat p + E$:
```{webr}
0.413 - E
0.413 + E
```
4. Are these numbers similar to your $u$ and $v$ from the previous exercise?
:::

::: {#exr-binom-approx-2}
Now run through the steps of the previous exercise but with the numbers for $n = 10$ from @exr-random-experiment. (Remember to change the `/1000` to `/10` in part 2.) Are these numbers similar to the first set of $u$ and $v$ we found?
:::

## Miscellanea

Using the formula $n = \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 0.25}{E^2}$ (which we use if $\hat p$ is unknown) we can estimate how many samples we need to achieve a desired error.

::: {#exr-sample-size}
1. Suppose we want to be really really sure of $p$ and we want the error to be no more than $0.001$ (e.g. our confidence interval would be $0.399$ to $0.401$). Compute this $n$ (either by typing in the formula or using your own calculator)
```{webr}

```
2. Now let's use this for a `qbeta` confidence interval:
```{webr}
# Fill in:
n <- 1000

black <- sum(random_experiment(n))
white <- n - black

qbeta(0.025, black + 1, white + 1)
qbeta(0.975, black + 1, white + 1)
```
3. This has all assumed we wanted to be 95\% confident. Suppose instead we want to be 99\% confident.
    * What is $\alpha = 1 - 0.99$?
    * What is $\alpha / 2$?
    * What is $1 - \alpha / 2$?
4. Take your value of $1 - \alpha / 2$ and compute `qnorm(1 - alpha / 2)`
```{webr}
qnorm()
```
5. Replace the $1.96$ with this value when we were computing the normal approximation confidence interval:
```{webr}
phat <- 0.413 # replace with your phat from the n = 1000 experiment (Exercise 9.4)
qhat <- 1 - phat

# Replace the 1.96
E <- 1.96 * sqrt(phat * qhat / 1000)
phat - E
phat + E
```
6. Compared to the confidence interval from @exr-binom-approx, is this 99\%
   confidence interval *wider* or narrower* than the 95\% confidence interval?
:::

## t-distribution

For the following scenarios, compute

* $1 - \alpha/2$
* `qt(1 - \alpha / 2, df = n - 1)` (as an analogue of the 1.96 threshold)
* $E = \text{quantile-for-t} \cdot \frac{s}{\sqrt n}$.

::: {.callout-tip}
Reminder: quantiles are percentiles but for a decimal rather than a percent and the "t distribution" is like the normal distribution but with slightly larger percentiles due to the extra uncertainty in using $s$ rather than $\sigma$.
:::

Report something like $95\%\text{-CI for } \mu = \bar x \pm E = 41 \pm 3$

::: {#exm-t-dist}
Suppose scores for an exam have a mean of $75$ and sample standard deviation of $6$ with $n = 30$. For a 95\% confidence interval for $\mu$ ($\alpha = 0.05$):

* $1 - 0.05 / 2 = 0.975$
* `qt(0.975, df=29) = 2.04523`
* $E = 2.04523 \cdot 6 / \sqrt{30} = 2.240437$

A 95\% CI for $\mu$ is $75 \pm 2.24$ or $(72.76, 77.24)$
:::

```{webr}
1 - 0.05 / 2
```

```{webr}
qt(0.975, df = 29)
```

```{webr}
2.04523 * 6 / sqrt(30)
```

```{webr}
E <- 2.24
c(75 - E, 75 + E)
```

::: {#exr-t-dist-ci}
1. $\bar x = 70, s = 10, n = 49$ and we want a $99\%$ confidence interval ($\alpha = 0.01$)
2. $\bar x = 125, s = 12, n = 217$ and we want a $90\%$ confidence interval ($\alpha = 0.1$)
3. $\bar x = 60, s = 8, n = 5103$ and we want a $96\%$ confidence interval ($\alpha = 0.04$)
