# Calculating Mean, Median, etc. in R {.unnumbered}

We've seen the `mean()` function before in Activity 1. This calculates the mean
of a set of data. For instance

```{webr}
dice_values = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
mean(dice_values)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
The short-hand for a consecutive list like `c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)` is `1:6`. Try
changing the first line to `dice_values = 1:20` and get the average dice value
on a 20 sided dieâ€”common in tabletop games like Dungeons & Dragons.
:::

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using QuizQuestions
numericq(10.5; label="What is the average roll on a 20 sided die?")
```

Likewise, the `median()`, `sd()`, `var()`, and `range()` functions exists to
calculate the median, (sample) standard deviation, (sample) variance, and range
(as an interval) respectively. Remember that the sample standard deviation or
variance formulas have a denominator of $n - 1$ rather than $n$.

```{webr}
data = c(4.9, 0.7, 1.8, 1.1, 0.6, 1.8)
mean(data)
median(data)
sd(data)
var(data)
range(data)
```

## Mode

Mode is a less common calculation and R does not have a function to calculate it.

Instead, we can calculate the mode as we did in Activity 1 by using the
`table()` function and then reading the output to determine which data point
occurred the most.

```{webr}
data = c(4.9, 0.7, 1.8, 1.1, 0.6, 1.8)
table(data)
```

```{julia}
#| echo: false
choices = [0.6, 0.7, 1.1, 1.8, 4.9]
radioq(choices, 4; label="Which value appears the most times?", keep_order=true)
```

# Calculating summary statistics in Desmos

In [Desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/bhm2vncpzq){target="_blank"}, you can enter a list of numbers like
$$
a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] \text{ or } a = [1...6].
$$
(Variables in Desmos are limited to a single letter.)

|          Statistic          |     R     |      Desmos      |
|:---------------------------:|:---------:|:----------------:|
|             Mean            |  mean(a)  |     mean(a)      |
|            Median           | median(a) |    median(a)     |
|      (Sample) Variance      |   var(a)  |      var(a)      |
| (Sample) Standard Deviation |   sd(a)   |     stdev(a)     |
|    Range (as an interval)   |  range(a) | (min(a), max(a)) |
