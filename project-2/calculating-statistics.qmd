# Calculating Mean, Median, etc. in R {.unnumbered}

We've seen the `mean()` function before in Activity 1. This calculates the mean
of a set of data. For instance

```{webr}
dice_values = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
mean(dice_values)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
The short-hand for a consecutive list like `1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6` is `1:6`. Try changing the `dice_values` variable to `1:20` and get the
average dice value on a 20 sided dieâ€”common in tabletop games like Dungeons &
Dragons.
:::

```{julia}
#| echo: false
using QuizQuestions
numericq(10.5; label="What is the average roll on a 20 sided die?")
```

Likewise, the `median()`, `sd()`, `var()`, and `range()` functions exists to calculate the median, (sample) standard deviation, (sample) variance, and range respectively. Remember that the sample s.d. or var formulas have a denominator of $n - 1$ rather than $n$.

```{webr}
data = c(4.9, 0.7, 1.8, 1.1, 0.6, 1.8)
mean(data)
median(data)
sd(data)
var(data)
range(data)
```

## Mode

Mode is a less common calculation and the `mode()` function in R does **not**
calculate the mode but does something much different having to do with
programming internals.

Instead, we can calculate the mode as we did in Activity 1 by using the
`table()` function and then reading the output to determine which data point
occurred the most.

```{webr}
data = c(4.9, 0.7, 1.8, 1.1, 0.6, 1.8)
table(data)
```
